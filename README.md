# Open Micro-Manipulator GUI

**Open Micro-Manipulator GUI** is a small graphical user interface for controlling the [Open Micro-Manipulator](https://github.com/0x23/MicroManipulatorStepper), featuring a live microscope camera view for real-time feedback.
You  can find the Open Micro-Manipulator repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. Install the required Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

Make sure you are using a compatible Python version and that your hardware is properly connected before launching the GUI.

## Configuration

The serial port and the live view camera can be found in main.py.

## Camera

The program can display a live camera feed using the open-cv image capturing framework. For best experience I recommend a camera capable of capturing 60 frames per second (also make sure you are not limited by the cameras shutter time).

## Running G-Code

The G-Code runner supports **simple absolute movement commands** of the form: `G0 X Y Z F`. All other commands are ignored.
You may press the 'Set Origin' button to set the current device loaction as zero position for running the G-Code.

> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> Running G-Code that exceeds the machine’s physical limits may cause rapid and uncontrolled movements. Use with caution.

### Scaling
A custom scaling directive can be added at the beginning of a G-Code file: `SCALE=0.123`.
This is useful when running G-Code generated by external software, such as 3D-printing slicers.
